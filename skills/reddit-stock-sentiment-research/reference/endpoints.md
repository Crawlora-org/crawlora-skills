## Reddit (4)

### `reddit_comments`

- **HTTP:** `GET /reddit/comments/{id}`
- **What:** Get Reddit post comments. Returns a Reddit post with its public comments. The default 1-credit mode uses RSS. Set `include_metrics=true` to use the anonymous HTML post page as the sole content request and return the server-rendered comments with public net score and award count plus post engagement metrics for 3 credits. Large threads may expose only an initial comment subset in anonymous HTML. Reddit does not expose per-comment upvote ratios or exact upvote/downvote totals anonymously. A post that exists but has no comments yet returns a 200 response with an empty comments list; a post that does not exist returns 404, and a temporary block or upstream failure returns 503 (retryable) rather than 404. Native-source failures can use the internal Redlib fallback; source.type is redlib and public fields/credit weights are preserved.
- **Params:** `depth` (integer, optional) — Maximum flat comment depth returned in metrics mode.; `id` (string, **required**) — Reddit post id or t3_ id; `include_metrics` (boolean, optional) — Include public post and per-comment engagement metrics; costs 3 credits instead of 1; `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum comments returned, defaults to 25 and clamps to 100; `sort` (string, optional) — Comment order: confidence, top, new, controversial, old, or qa. Applied to the anonymous HTML request when metrics are enabled.

### `reddit_post`

- **HTTP:** `GET /reddit/post/{id}`
- **What:** Get Reddit post. Returns a normalized public Reddit post. The default 1-credit mode uses RSS. Set `include_metrics=true` to use the anonymous HTML post page as the sole content request and return public net score, upvote ratio, comment count, award count, and estimated upvote/downvote totals for 3 credits. Reddit fuzzes voting data, so estimates are approximate; share, repost/crosspost, and view counts are not exposed anonymously. Native-source failures can use the internal Redlib fallback; source.type is redlib and public fields/credit weights are preserved.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Reddit post id or t3_ id; `include_metrics` (boolean, optional) — Include public engagement metrics; costs 3 credits instead of 1

### `reddit_search`
