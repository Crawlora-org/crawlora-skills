Only the endpoints used by this workflow. Call them via `scripts/crawlora.sh` (see SKILL.md).

All paths are relative to the API base `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1` and require the header `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY`. Path params like `{id}` are substituted into the URL; `GET` params go in the query string; `POST` params go in a JSON body.

## Datasets (2)

### `datasets_jobs_companies`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/jobs/companies`
- **What:** Find which companies are hiring. Searches the discovered company board registry — which companies are hiring, on which ATS (or, for the 5 single-company big-tech providers, which platform), with how many open roles. Set sponsors_visa=true to keep companies with certified employer filings in recent public U.S. Department of Labor LCA disclosure data. This is company-level historical evidence, not a guarantee for a specific role or candidate. provider enum: `greenhouse`, `lever`, `ashby`, `workday`, `smartrecruiters`, `workable`, `recruitee`, `rippling`, `personio`, `teamtailor`, `oracle`, `ukg`, `icims`, `eightfold`, `gem`, `pinpoint`, `amazon-jobs`, `apple-jobs`, `google-jobs`, `meta-jobs`, `tesla-jobs`. status enum: `active`, `empty`, `gone`, `blocked`, `pending`, `invalid`. sort enum: `open_desc`, `company_asc`, `crawled_desc`.
- **Params:** `min_open_roles` (integer, optional) — Minimum open roles; `page` (integer, optional) — Page number, default 1; `page_size` (integer, optional) — Page size, default 20, max 100; `provider` (string, optional) — Provider filter; `q` (string, optional) — Match on company name / domain; `sort` (string, optional) — Sort enum: open_desc, company_asc, crawled_desc; `sponsors_visa` (boolean, optional) — Keep companies with recent certified DOL LCA filings (default false); `status` (string, optional) — Board status.

### `datasets_jobs_company_item`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/jobs/companies/{id}`
- **What:** Get a single company by board id. Returns one discovered company board by its dataset board id. When the company name matches recent public U.S. Department of Labor LCA disclosure data, the response includes `lca_sponsorship` with filing counts and observed fiscal-quarter range; this is company-level historical evidence, not a guarantee for a specific role or candidate. When the board carries a known domain, the response also includes a `tech_stack` firmographic hint. Returns 404 when the board id is not in the registry.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Dataset board id

## Jobs (1)

### `jobs_company_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /jobs/company-search`
- **What:** Find which ATS a company uses by slug. Probes Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Workable, Recruitee, Rippling, Teamtailor, and Pinpoint in parallel for a slug and reports the providers where it resolves to a non-empty board (with the open-role count and board URL). Workday is excluded (its board needs tenant + datacenter + site). Credential-free public ATS JSON.
- **Params:** `slug` (string, **required**) — Company careers slug to probe

## Bing (1)

### `bing_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /bing/search`
- **What:** Search Bing web results. Returns normalized Bing web search results for a query string, including organic results, optional context panel data, related queries, people-also-ask questions, news modules, video modules, and page-based pagination. Empty optional blocks are omitted from the JSON response. Locale defaults to country=us and lang=en-us. Results are fetched with a Chrome-impersonated request client and return 503 on a genuine transport failure or challenge page. Bing occasionally serves a well-formed page whose results share no significant term with the query; when every hedged attempt hits this, the response is still returned as 200 with data.low_confidence set to true (and the X-Low-Confidence header) instead of being withheld, so callers get Bing's real answer plus an honest signal to double-check it rather than nothing. Queries that use the site: operator (for example site:gov.hu) are not supported: Bing serves a bot-verification challenge for them, so they are rejected with 400 before any request is made. Use the DuckDuckGo (/api/v1/duckduckgo/search), Brave (/api/v1/brave/search), or Yahoo (/api/v1/yahoo-search/search) search endpoints for domain-restricted searches instead.
- **Params:** `count` (integer, optional) — Results per page; defaults to 10, clamped to 1..50; `country` (string, optional) — Two-letter country code; defaults to us; `lang` (string, optional) — Bing UI language; defaults to en-us; `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based page number; defaults to 1; `q` (string, **required**) — Search query

## Web (1)

### `web_scrape`

- **HTTP:** `POST /web/scrape`
- **What:** Scrape a URL into markdown, HTML, links or metadata. Fetches a single public URL and returns clean content in the requested formats (markdown, html, raw_html, links, metadata). The request body IS the ScrapeOption object itself — e.g. {"url": "https://example.com"} — do not wrap it in an extra key. With render=auto the request starts as a fast HTTP fetch and escalates to a real browser when the page is blocked or rendered with JavaScript; backend only pins a specific headless-browser engine for the browser tier and is not a render mode. only_main_content (default true) strips navigation, headers, footers and other boilerplate before conversion. Only public pages are supported; respect each site's terms of use and robots directives. A handful of popular sites (Amazon, Reddit, Yelp, LinkedIn, and others) already have a dedicated, more reliable endpoint elsewhere in this API — a failed scrape against one of them names it.
- **Params:** `scrapeOption` (object, **required**) — Scrape options
- **REST body:** Send the value of the MCP argument `scrapeOption` directly as the JSON body; do not wrap it in a `scrapeOption` property.
