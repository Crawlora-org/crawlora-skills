Only the endpoints used by this workflow. Call them via `scripts/crawlora.sh` (see SKILL.md).

All paths are relative to the API base `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1` and require the header `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY`. Path params like `{id}` are substituted into the URL; `GET` params go in the query string; `POST` params go in a JSON body.

**24 endpoints across 2 platform group(s).**

## Slickdeals (11)

### `slickdeals_categories`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/categories`
- **What:** List every Slickdeals deal category/tag. Returns Slickdeals' own full category/tag list -- the discovery endpoint for GET /slickdeals/category's slug parameter. This is a separate taxonomy from the category/sub_category fields GET /slickdeals/deal returns for an individual deal (Slickdeals maintains multiple parallel category/tag id spaces, not one) -- these slugs are the ones GET /slickdeals/category's own browse pages accept. The list is refreshed from Slickdeals' own site periodically; an optional q parameter narrows it to a substring match.
- **Params:** `q` (string, optional) — Case-insensitive substring filter on slug or name

### `slickdeals_category`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/category`
- **What:** Browse current deals in one Slickdeals category/tag. Returns the current deal listing for one Slickdeals category/tag (e.g. "laptop-bag", "apparel"): for each deal, title, price, list price, store, community vote score, comment count, the public username who posted it, and status flags (is_popular, is_expired, is_new, is_frontpage). slug must be one of the values from GET /slickdeals/categories -- an unrecognized slug returns a typed invalid-parameter error rather than being sent upstream. Pair a result's thread_id or url with GET /slickdeals/deal for the full detail record (description, full taxonomy).
- **Params:** `slug` (string, **required**) — Category/tag slug from GET /slickdeals/categories

### `slickdeals_comments`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/comments`
- **What:** Get one Slickdeals deal thread's comments. Returns one Slickdeals deal thread's full comment thread: for each comment, the public username who posted it (with their forum rank/title and total post count -- the same public-forum-post attribution class this repo already exposes for Reddit), the comment content (as HTML and as cleaned plain text), when it was posted, a permalink, and reaction counts (like, funny, helpful, not helpful). Give either url (the exact value returned by GET /slickdeals/search or GET /slickdeals/deal) or thread_id; at least one is required. has_more indicates whether Slickdeals' own page truncated the reply list (no further pagination is currently exposed by this endpoint).
- **Params:** `thread_id` (integer, optional) — Slickdeals numeric thread id; `url` (string, optional) — Full Slickdeals deal URL, as returned by GET /slickdeals/search or GET /slickdeals/deal (https://slickdeals.net/f/...)

### `slickdeals_deal`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/deal`
- **What:** Get one Slickdeals deal thread's full detail. Returns one Slickdeals deal thread's full detail: title, store, final/list price, community vote score, comment count, whether the deal is marked expired, the deal's product category and taxonomy (category/sub_category/category_paths, and separately the legacy forum/forum_id the thread was posted under), the public Slickdeals username who posted it ("found by" attribution, the same public-forum-post class this repo already exposes for Reddit) with a public community-standing summary (reputation, join date, deals posted, total votes/comments), a related_deals sidebar (Slickdeals' own Popular/Trending picks), the outbound merchant link, and the deal's own description. Give either url (the exact value returned by GET /slickdeals/search) or thread_id (Slickdeals' own numeric thread id, e.g. from a deal's URL path /f/{thread_id}-...); at least one is required. An unknown or removed deal returns 404.
- **Params:** `thread_id` (integer, optional) — Slickdeals numeric thread id; `url` (string, optional) — Full Slickdeals deal URL, as returned by GET /slickdeals/search (https://slickdeals.net/f/...)

### `slickdeals_deal_types`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/deal-types`
- **What:** List every Slickdeals deal-type tag. Returns Slickdeals' own deal-type tag list (Coupon, Free / Freebie, Giveaway, Gift Card, Mail In Rebate, Online Only, YMMV, ...) -- the discovery endpoint for GET /slickdeals/search's deal_type_id parameter. Confirmed identical across multiple Slickdeals sub-forums, unlike the broader interest-tag space it is drawn from, which was not found to be reliably enumerable. An optional q parameter narrows it to a substring match on name.
- **Params:** `q` (string, optional) — Case-insensitive substring filter on name

### `slickdeals_forums`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/forums`
- **What:** List every Slickdeals legacy sub-forum. Returns Slickdeals' own full legacy sub-forum list (e.g. Hot Deals, Coupons, Freebies) -- the discovery endpoint for GET /slickdeals/search's forum_id parameter. A separate, coarser-grained taxonomy from GET /slickdeals/categories' 421-entry tag list: this is the classification GET /slickdeals/deal, /slickdeals/search/advanced, and /slickdeals/frontpage already surface as forum_id, with this endpoint as the way to resolve an id to a name or filter search results by it. The list is refreshed from Slickdeals' own site periodically; an optional q parameter narrows it to a substring match on name.
- **Params:** `q` (string, optional) — Case-insensitive substring filter on name

### `slickdeals_frontpage`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/frontpage`
- **What:** Browse Slickdeals' own homepage deal feed. Returns one page of Slickdeals' own homepage deal listing -- the deals Slickdeals itself is currently featuring, distinct from a keyword search or a single category/tag's own listing. Each deal carries the same fields as GET /slickdeals/search/advanced's results (real integer vote/comment/view counts, store id, discount, status flags), plus is_fire_deal and has_rebate flags this feed's cards carry. Pagination is next-page-only (has_next_page), since the page itself exposes no total page count.
- **Params:** `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based frontpage listing page, default 1

### `slickdeals_primary_categories`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/primary-categories`
- **What:** List Slickdeals' featured primary-category landing pages. Returns Slickdeals' small, curated set of "featured" primary-category landing pages (e.g. laptop-deals, tv-deals) -- the discovery endpoint for GET /slickdeals/primary-category's slug parameter. This is a separate taxonomy from GET /slickdeals/categories' 421-entry tag list and from GET /slickdeals/deal's own category/sub_category fields -- Slickdeals maintains multiple parallel category/tag id spaces, not one. Unlike /slickdeals/categories, no single live page enumerates this set; it is maintained as periodically-refreshed reference data.
- **Params:** `q` (string, optional) — Case-insensitive substring filter on slug or name

### `slickdeals_primary_category`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/primary-category`
- **What:** Browse current deals in one Slickdeals featured primary category. Returns the current deal listing for one Slickdeals featured primary-category landing page (e.g. laptop-deals, tv-deals): for each deal, title, price, list price, store, community vote score, comment count, found-by username, and status flags. slug must be one of the values from GET /slickdeals/primary-categories -- an unrecognized slug (including a valid GET /slickdeals/categories tag slug, which is a different taxonomy) returns a typed invalid-parameter error rather than being sent upstream.
- **Params:** `slug` (string, **required**) — Featured-category slug from GET /slickdeals/primary-categories

### `slickdeals_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/search`
- **What:** Search Slickdeals community-submitted deals by keyword. Searches Slickdeals (slickdeals.net), a community deal/coupon aggregator, for deal threads matching a free-text keyword query -- the same search this repo already exposes for Reddit, applied to Slickdeals' own deal-posting community. Each result is one community-submitted deal thread with its title (which conventionally embeds the deal price), a best-effort price extracted from that title, the merchant domain, the community vote ("thumb") score, the public Slickdeals username who posted it, and when it was posted. Pair a result's thread_id or url with GET /slickdeals/deal for the full detail record, including comment count and category. An optional forum_id restricts results to one Slickdeals legacy sub-forum (e.g. Hot Deals, Coupons) -- obtain a value from GET /slickdeals/forums, a closed enum validated before the request reaches upstream. An optional deal_type_id restricts results to one Slickdeals deal-type tag (e.g. Coupon, Free / Freebie, YMMV) -- obtain a value from GET /slickdeals/deal-types, also a closed enum validated before the request reaches upstream; composes with forum_id.
- **Params:** `deal_type_id` (integer, optional) — Restrict results to one Slickdeals deal-type tag, from GET /slickdeals/deal-types; `forum_id` (integer, optional) — Restrict results to one Slickdeals legacy sub-forum, from GET /slickdeals/forums; `q` (string, **required**) — Free-text keyword query

### `slickdeals_search_advanced`

- **HTTP:** `GET /slickdeals/search/advanced`
- **What:** Search Slickdeals with real pagination, counts, and facets. Searches Slickdeals' modern search surface -- a richer alternative to GET /slickdeals/search's keyword-only RSS feed. Returns real pagination (page/total_pages/per_page/result_count), integer vote/comment/view counts read directly from the page's own data (not parsed from free text), a fuller per-deal record (store id, discount percent, status flags), and facets -- Categories, Stores, and Brands available for the current query, each option carrying a value usable as category_id/brand_id/store_id. Facet values and counts are scoped to the current query, not a site-wide enumeration -- category_id/brand_id/store_id are passthrough filters (obtain a value from a prior response's own facets), not validated against a closed enum. sort defaults to relevance; other values are passed through unvalidated since no server-side enumeration of the full accepted set was found.
- **Params:** `brand_id` (integer, optional) — Brand facet id, from a prior response's own facets; `category_id` (integer, optional) — Category facet id, from a prior response's own facets; `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based result page, default 1; `q` (string, **required**) — Free-text keyword query; `sort` (string, optional) — Sort order, default relevance; `store_id` (integer, optional) — Store facet id, from a prior response's own facets
