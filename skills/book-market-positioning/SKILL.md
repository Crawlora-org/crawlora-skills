# Book market positioning

## Access and scope

Set `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` to your Crawlora key. Prefer the listed Crawlora MCP tools
when connected; otherwise use the bundled `scripts/crawlora.sh`, which sends
`x-api-key` to `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`. Read
[reference/endpoints.md](reference/endpoints.md) for exact methods and parameters.
Check application `code` as well as HTTP status; payloads are inside `data`.
Stop on authentication errors, back off on `429`, and retry a transient upstream
failure once. Bound calls/pages by the requested scope and credit budget. Retain
source IDs, URLs, source dates, and observation/crawl times separately.

Build a comparable-title map for a specified topic, genre, reader need, format,
language, and publication window. Use a supplied title list first and separate
reader-fit evidence from commercial performance claims.

## Discover titles and reconcile works with editions

1. Discover Goodreads dataset genres, formats, languages, publishers, and
   publication-year values before exact filters. The index is seeded from lists,
   search sweeps, and author expansion; it is not every published/Goodreads book.
   Stored popularity sorting and minimum rating counts change the sample.
2. Resolve returned book/author IDs, then inspect selected live book and edition
   records. Goodreads book IDs and work IDs are different namespaces; the editions
   route takes a book ID and resolves its work internally. Use returned work/edition
   links rather than similar titles to group translations, printings, and formats.
3. Preserve all credited contributors and their roles when returned. A dataset
   author filter can match a translator, editor, or other credited contributor;
   it does not guarantee that person is the primary author. Similar author names
   do not establish identity or a shared bibliography.
4. Cross-check Apple Books/Audible listings only for the requested formats. Match
   title, author, language, edition/ISBN when present, narration, abridgment, and
   runtime. Missing ISBN does not prove two editions are identical. Ratings may
   describe a work-level community or a particular storefront/edition; retain
   their populations rather than adding them into a universal reader count.

# Use returned book IDs before live detail/editions/review samples.
```

## Compare positioning and reception

Build a topic/reader/format matrix from supplied descriptions and bounded review
samples, preserving excerpts, dates, sample sizes, and uncertain labels. Separate
story/topic, audience claims, length, publication period, format, and reviewer
experience. A review complaint is a hypothesis to investigate, not representative
market demand. A translator/edition difference can explain apparent content gaps.

Report distinct works and edition counts separately. Do not sum possibly shared
work-level ratings across editions, interpret chart rank or rating counts as
sales, infer publisher revenue, or treat absence from the sample as a market gap.
Return the comparable-title matrix, edition/identity ledger, reception evidence,
observed positioning opportunities, and missing coverage. Historical trends
require comparable saved observations rather than two current popularity lists.
Do not contact authors/publishers or purchase books from this research request.
