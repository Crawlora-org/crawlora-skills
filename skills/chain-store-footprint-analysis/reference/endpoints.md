## Datasets (8)

### `datasets_google_map_facets`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/google-map-businesses/facets`
- **What:** Facet stored Google Maps businesses. Returns terms aggregation counts for Google Maps businesses. Facet enum: `category`, `country`, `state`, `state_code`, `county`, `county_code`, `city`, `town`, `website_status`. Category facet values are exact locale-specific Google Maps labels and can be localized, non-ASCII, or contain punctuation; pass a returned value unchanged to the category filter. `state` and `county` keep each country's own administrative vocabulary (e.g. `Provincia de Madrid`, `Département du Nord`); `state_code` and `county_code` are the matching ISO 3166-2 codes (e.g. `ES-MD`, `FR-59`) and are the stable cross-country grouping key. Rows not yet resolved carry no code and are absent from the code facets.
- **Params:** `category` (string, optional) — Exact locale-specific Google Maps category label; use the category facet to discover values, max 128 characters; `city` (string, optional) — Exact city filter, max 128 characters; `country` (string, optional) — Country filter. Accepts the full English name (\; `county` (string, optional) — Exact county filter, max 128 characters; `county_code` (string, optional) — Exact ISO 3166-2 county/district code filter, e.g. FR-59 or IT-RM, max 128 characters; use facet=county_code to discover values; `facet` (string, **required**) — Facet enum: category, country, state, state_code, county, county_code, city, town, website_status; `has_geo` (boolean, optional) — Filter by location presence: true keeps only mappable businesses with coordinates; false isolates locationless service-area businesses that have no map location; `has_phone` (boolean, optional) — Filter by phone presence; `has_website` (boolean, optional) — Filter by website presence; `lat` (number, optional) — Latitude for radius filtering; `lon` (number, optional) — Longitude for radius filtering; `min_rating` (number, optional) — Minimum rating, 0 through 5. Businesses with no aggregate Google rating are returned with rating null, so any min_rating above 0 excludes them.; `min_review_count` (integer, optional) — Minimum review count; `permanently_closed` (boolean, optional) — Closure filter. true keeps only businesses Google marks Permanently closed; false excludes them, keeping every business not known to be closed. Most rows have never been status-checked and are returned with permanently_closed null, which means unknown, not open.; `q` (string, optional) — Full-text business search query, max 256 characters; `radius_m` (integer, optional) — Radius in meters, 1 through 50000; requires lat and lon when supplied; `sort` (string, optional) — Sort enum: relevance, updated_at_desc, rating_desc, review_count_desc, distance_asc; `state` (string, optional) — Exact state filter, max 128 characters; `state_code` (string, optional) — Exact ISO 3166-2 state/region code filter, e.g. US-CA or FR-HDF, max 128 characters; use facet=state_code to discover values; `town` (string, optional) — Exact town filter, max 128 characters

### `datasets_google_map_item`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/google-map-businesses/items/{place_id}`
- **What:** Get a stored Google Maps business. Returns one stored Google Maps business by Google place_id from dataset id enum value `google-map-businesses`. The `category` field contains the exact Google Maps category label returned for the business locale and can be localized, non-ASCII, or contain punctuation. A `rating` of `null` means no aggregate rating is available. A `review_count` of `null` means Google did not return a count; numeric `0` means Google confirmed zero reviews. Locationless service-area businesses (online/mobile/home-based) have a `null` `geo`. A `permanently_closed` of `true` means Google marks the business permanently closed; `false` means a crawl confirmed it does not; `null` means the business has not been status-checked since capture shipped on 2026-08-31 and is UNKNOWN, not open — so any total computed from this dataset includes an unknown number of closed businesses.
- **Params:** `place_id` (string, **required**) — Google Place ID, max 256 characters

### `datasets_google_map_nearby`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/google-map-businesses/nearby`
- **What:** Search nearby stored Google Maps businesses. Searches stored Google Maps businesses near a coordinate in dataset id enum value `google-map-businesses`. `category` is the exact Google Maps category label returned for the business locale; it can be localized, non-ASCII, or contain punctuation, so use the category facet to discover exact filter values. A `rating` of `null` means no aggregate rating is available. A `review_count` of `null` means Google did not return a count; numeric `0` means Google confirmed zero reviews. `min_rating` above 0 excludes unrated businesses.

### `datasets_google_map_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/google-map-businesses/search`
- **What:** Search stored Google Maps businesses. Searches Google Maps business records stored in a search index. Sort enum: `relevance`, `updated_at_desc`, `rating_desc`, `review_count_desc`, `distance_asc`. `category` is the exact Google Maps category label returned for the business locale; it can be localized, non-ASCII, or contain punctuation, so use the category facet to discover exact filter values. A `rating` of `null` means no aggregate rating is available. A `review_count` of `null` means Google did not return a count; numeric `0` means Google confirmed zero reviews. `rating_desc` sorts unrated businesses last, and `min_rating` above 0 excludes them. Use `has_geo=false` to isolate locationless service-area businesses (which have a `null` `geo`). A `permanently_closed` of `true` means Google marks the business permanently closed; `false` means a crawl confirmed it does not; `null` means the business has not been status-checked since capture shipped on 2026-08-31 and is UNKNOWN, not open — so any total computed from this dataset includes an unknown number of closed businesses.

### `datasets_starbucks_stores_facets`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/starbucks-stores/facets`
- **What:** Facet stored Starbucks stores. Returns terms aggregation counts for the Starbucks store directory. Facet enum: `country`, `state`, `market`, `amenities`, `ownership_type_code`. Accepts the same filter parameters as search to scope the aggregation.
- **Params:** `amenity` (string, optional) — Amenity code filter, e.g. DT; `city` (string, optional) — Exact city filter; `country` (string, optional) — ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country filter; `facet` (string, **required**) — Facet enum: country, state, market, amenities, ownership_type_code; `market` (string, optional) — Crawl-provenance market filter. One of: us, ca; `q` (string, optional) — Full-text search over store name, city, and address; `state` (string, optional) — State/region code filter

### `datasets_starbucks_stores_item`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/starbucks-stores/items/{store_number}`
- **What:** Get a stored Starbucks store. Returns one stored Starbucks store by its store number (e.g. `101-54`) from dataset id `starbucks-stores`. `country` is the store's true country while `market` is crawl provenance. Hours (`schedule`) and `amenities` may be empty for stores outside the US, Canada, Europe, and the Gulf; an empty schedule means "not published for this market", not "closed".
- **Params:** `store_number` (string, **required**) — Starbucks store number, e.g. 101-54

### `datasets_starbucks_stores_nearby`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/starbucks-stores/nearby`
- **What:** Find nearby stored Starbucks stores. Returns stored Starbucks stores within a radius of a point, nearest first, from dataset id `starbucks-stores`. lat, lon, and radius_m are required. Unlike the live /starbucks/stores endpoint (which caps at 50 near a point), this queries the full grid-tiled directory, so it can return every store in the radius.
- **Params:** `amenity` (string, optional) — Amenity code filter, e.g. DT; `country` (string, optional) — ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country filter; `lat` (number, **required**) — Center latitude, from -90 through 90; `lon` (number, **required**) — Center longitude, from -180 through 180; `page` (integer, optional) — Page number, defaults to 1; `page_size` (integer, optional) — Page size, defaults to 20 and maxes at 100; `radius_m` (integer, **required**) — Search radius in meters, 1 through 50000

### `datasets_starbucks_stores_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/starbucks-stores/search`
- **What:** Search the Starbucks store directory. Searches the worldwide Starbucks store directory (dataset id `starbucks-stores`), built by grid-tiling the store locator around its 50-result cap. Each store has its store number, name, phone, full address, coordinates, weekly hours, amenity codes, and pick-up options. Store discovery is global, but hours, amenities, and phone numbers are populated per market and are largely absent outside the US, Canada, Europe, and the Gulf; an empty schedule means "not published for this market", not "closed". `country` is the store's true country while `market` is crawl provenance (the US host geocodes worldwide). Supports full-text `q`, `country`/`state`/`city`/`market`/`amenity` filters, `lat`/`lon`/`radius_m` radius filtering, and `sort` (relevance, distance_asc).
- **Params:** `amenity` (string, optional) — Amenity code filter, e.g. DT (Drive-Thru), XO (Mobile Order and Pay); `city` (string, optional) — Exact city filter; `country` (string, optional) — ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country filter, e.g. US, GB, JP; `lat` (number, optional) — Latitude for radius filtering or distance sort, requires lon; `lon` (number, optional) — Longitude for radius filtering or distance sort, requires lat; `market` (string, optional) — Crawl-provenance market filter. One of: us, ca; `page` (integer, optional) — Page number, defaults to 1; `page_size` (integer, optional) — Page size, defaults to 20 and maxes at 100; page * page_size must be <= 10000; `q` (string, optional) — Full-text search over store name, city, and address, max 256 characters; `radius_m` (integer, optional) — Radius in meters, 1 through 50000; requires lat and lon; `sort` (string, optional) — Sort enum: relevance, distance_asc; `state` (string, optional) — State/region code filter, e.g. WA

## Starbucks (2)

### `starbucks_nearest_store`

- **HTTP:** `GET /starbucks/nearest-store`
- **What:** Locate the closest Starbucks to a coordinate. Returns the coordinates and distance of the single closest Starbucks store to a point. Both lat and lng are required. This endpoint returns coordinates only, not store details: it is what Starbucks' own store locator uses to centre its map. Use /starbucks/stores for full store records. A point with no nearby store returns a well-formed result with found set to false rather than an error. market selects which Starbucks country site answers, one of us or ca, defaulting to us.
- **Params:** `lat` (number, **required**) — Latitude; `lng` (number, **required**) — Longitude; `market` (string, optional) — Starbucks country site to read. One of: us, ca. Defaults to us

### `starbucks_stores`

- **HTTP:** `GET /starbucks/stores`
- **What:** Find nearby Starbucks stores worldwide. Returns Starbucks store locations near a point: store number, name, phone, full address, coordinates, weekly opening hours, amenities, and pick-up options. Either place, or both lat and lng, is required. place is free-text (city, address, or postal code) and is geocoded by Starbucks itself, so it works worldwide. market selects which Starbucks country site answers, one of us or ca, defaulting to us; this is not cosmetic even for stores, because the same store reports different operational data depending on the host. There is no filter parameter: Starbucks' own API accepts a features amenity filter but silently ignores it, so it is deliberately not offered here; filter on each store's returned amenities instead. A place Starbucks cannot resolve returns a well-formed empty result with place_not_found set to true rather than an error. The upstream returns at most 50 stores per request and supports no pagination; result_capped is true when that ceiling was reached. Store discovery works worldwide, but hours, amenities, and phone numbers are populated per market and may be absent outside the US and UK.
- **Params:** `lat` (number, optional) — Latitude, requires lng; `lng` (number, optional) — Longitude, requires lat; `market` (string, optional) — Starbucks country site to read. One of: us, ca. Defaults to us; `place` (string, optional) — Free-text city, address, or postal code, geocoded by Starbucks

## McDonalds (1)

### `mcdonalds_restaurants`

- **HTTP:** `GET /mcdonalds/restaurants`
- **What:** Find McDonald's restaurants near a location. Returns McDonald's restaurants near a latitude/longitude, in any of ten markets. Each restaurant carries its store id, name, street address, city, state, postal code, phone, coordinates, timezone, open status, today's dining and drive-thru hours, the full published week of hours, and McDonald's own amenity codes (for example DRIVETHRU, WIFI, MOBILEOFFERS, GIFTCARDS). A delivery deep link is included where McDonald's publishes one; note it points at a third-party delivery platform. A coordinate with no McDonald's nearby returns an empty list rather than an error. Set country to search outside the United States -- the locator covers more markets than the menu and item endpoints do, so a country valid here is not necessarily valid there.
- **Params:** `country` (string, optional) — Market to search (default us). One of us, gb, ca, au, de, ie, nz, ch, nl, se.; `latitude` (number, **required**) — Search center latitude; `longitude` (number, **required**) — Search center longitude; `max_results` (integer, optional) — Maximum restaurants to return, 1-50 (default 10); `radius` (integer, optional) — Search radius in miles, 1-100 (default 20)

## Google (2)

### `google_map_place`

- **HTTP:** `GET /google/map/place/{place_id}`
- **What:** Google Maps place details API. Returns detailed information for a specified place_id. Rate limit is enforced at 1 request per second.
- **Params:** `place_id` (string, **required**) — Google Place ID

### `google_map_search`

- **HTTP:** `POST /google/map/search`
- **What:** Google Maps search API. Returns results from Google Maps based on search options. Rate limit is enforced at 1 request per second.
- **Params:** `mapSearchOption` (object, **required**) — Search options
- **REST body:** Send the value of the MCP argument `mapSearchOption` directly as the JSON body; do not wrap it in a `mapSearchOption` property.
