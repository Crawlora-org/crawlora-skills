Credential-free public Capterra data, rendered from the search page through proxied browser renderers.

- **Params:** `q` (string, **required**) — Search query

## Adidas (3)

### `adidas_product_review_topics`

- **HTTP:** `GET /adidas/product/review-topics`
- **What:** Get Adidas review topics for a product. Returns the topics an Adidas product model's customer reviews can be filtered by -- the "filter by topic" chips the product page shows, commonly satisfaction, comfort, color, purchase, fit, appearance, quality and style. Feed a topics[].topic value back to /adidas/product/reviews as its topic parameter to return only reviews about that aspect. The topic vocabulary is per model, not a fixed list: a shoe exposes fit and comfort topics that an accessory does not, so read it per model rather than hard-coding it. model_number is the Adidas model number (e.g. SAMBAU2312) -- NOT the SKU: take it from an adidas_search result's products[].model_number field. A model with no reviews, including a well-formed but unrecognized model_number, returns an empty topics list rather than an error. Note the label field is a display form of topic, not translated text: Adidas returns the same English values for every locale on this route.
- **Params:** `locale` (string, optional) — Locale accepted for consistency with the reviews endpoint. Allowed values: cs_CZ, da_DK, de_AT, de_CH, de_DE, el_GR, en_AE, en_AU, en_CA, en_GB, en_IE, en_IL, en_IN, en_NZ, en_PH, en_SG, en_US, en_ZA, es_AR, es_CL, es_CO, es_ES, es_MX, es_PE, fr_BE, fr_CA, fr_CH, fr_FR, id_ID, it_CH, it_IT, ja_JP, ko_KR, nl_BE, nl_NL, pl_PL, pt_BR, pt_PT, ru_RU, sk_SK, sv_SE, th_TH, tr_TR, zh_HK, zh_TW. Defaults to en_US. Note Adidas returns the same English topic labels regardless of this value.; `model_number` (string, **required**) — Adidas model number, from an adidas_search result's products[].model_number field

### `adidas_product_reviews`

- **HTTP:** `GET /adidas/product/reviews`
- **What:** Get Adidas product reviews. Returns one page of customer reviews for an Adidas product model, plus the model's rating summary: overall rating, star histogram, percentage of reviewers who recommend it, per-attribute averages (Size, Width, Comfort, Quality with their own scale labels), and Adidas's AI-generated review digest when one exists. Each review carries the rating, headline, body, author nickname, purchased colorway, helpful/not-helpful vote counts, badges, customer photos, and submission time. model_number is the Adidas model number (e.g. SAMBAU2312) -- NOT the SKU: take it from an adidas_search result's products[].model_number field, which is a different value from products[].id. Reviews are returned 10 per page. Reviews are scoped to review text written in the requested locale's language, and most of the US catalog's reviews are English, so a non-English locale commonly returns rating statistics and a localized summary with an empty reviews list. A model with no reviews -- including a well-formed but unrecognized model_number -- returns an empty reviews list rather than an error, because Adidas answers 200 with a zero count rather than 404.
- **Params:** `locale` (string, optional) — Locale for the review-summary language, the secondary-rating scale labels, and the language of the reviews returned. Allowed values: cs_CZ, da_DK, de_AT, de_CH, de_DE, el_GR, en_AE, en_AU, en_CA, en_GB, en_IE, en_IL, en_IN, en_NZ, en_PH, en_SG, en_US, en_ZA, es_AR, es_CL, es_CO, es_ES, es_MX, es_PE, fr_BE, fr_CA, fr_CH, fr_FR, id_ID, it_CH, it_IT, ja_JP, ko_KR, nl_BE, nl_NL, pl_PL, pt_BR, pt_PT, ru_RU, sk_SK, sv_SE, th_TH, tr_TR, zh_HK, zh_TW. Defaults to en_US.; `model_number` (string, **required**) — Adidas model number, from an adidas_search result's products[].model_number field; `page` (integer, optional) — One-based page number, 10 reviews per page, defaults to 1; `rating` (integer, optional) — Return only reviews with this star rating. Allowed values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Omitted returns every rating.; `topic` (string, optional) — Return only reviews about one topic. Valid values are per-model -- read them from /adidas/product/review-topics for the same model_number (commonly satisfaction, comfort, color, purchase, fit, appearance, quality, style). An unrecognized topic returns a 400 listing the model's own topics.

### `adidas_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /adidas/search`
- **What:** Search or browse Adidas products. Searches Adidas.com product listings by keyword, or browses a category listing by taxonomy slug, with real pagination and sort options. Exactly one of query or category is required. Returns normalized product summaries (title, price, rating, images, color variants) plus facet filter groups, sort options, and (for category browse) a breadcrumb trail. Keyword search is best-effort relevance, not a guaranteed match: an obscure keyword returns whatever Adidas's own search index surfaces. A genuinely empty keyword search returns an empty product list, and requesting a page beyond the available result pages (or an unknown category) returns a not-found error. Category values are the path segment after /us/ in an Adidas category URL (e.g. women-athletic_sneakers); they can also be read from the url fields of a search/category response's own filters and breadcrumbs. Facets are applied by composing them into the category slug rather than by a separate parameter: each filters[].values[].slug is a token you splice into the category value (e.g. category=women-black-athletic_sneakers applies the Color=Black facet, and category=women-athletic_sneakers-prime applies Shipping=PRIME). Use filters[].key (the facet's stable name, e.g. searchcolor) rather than filters[].id, which is an opaque per-deployment UUID that cannot be used to build a request. Note the token's position within the slug varies by facet, so compose from a slug you have seen rather than assuming a fixed order.
- **Params:** `category` (string, optional) — Category/taxonomy slug, the path segment after /us/ in an Adidas category URL. Exactly one of query or category is required.; `page` (integer, optional) — One-based page number, defaults to 1; `query` (string, optional) — Search keyword. Exactly one of query or category is required.; `sort` (string, optional) — Sort order. Allowed values: price-low-to-high, newest-to-oldest, top-sellers, price-high-to-low. Omitted means relevance.

## Reddit (3)

### `reddit_comments`

- **HTTP:** `GET /reddit/comments/{id}`
- **What:** Get Reddit post comments. Returns a Reddit post with its public comments. The default 1-credit mode uses RSS. Set `include_metrics=true` to use the anonymous HTML post page as the sole content request and return the server-rendered comments with public net score and award count plus post engagement metrics for 3 credits. Large threads may expose only an initial comment subset in anonymous HTML. Reddit does not expose per-comment upvote ratios or exact upvote/downvote totals anonymously. A post that exists but has no comments yet returns a 200 response with an empty comments list; a post that does not exist returns 404, and a temporary block or upstream failure returns 503 (retryable) rather than 404.
- **Params:** `depth` (integer, optional) — Maximum flat comment depth returned in metrics mode.; `id` (string, **required**) — Reddit post id or t3_ id; `include_metrics` (boolean, optional) — Include public post and per-comment engagement metrics; costs 3 credits instead of 1; `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum comments returned, defaults to 25 and clamps to 100; `sort` (string, optional) — Comment order: confidence, top, new, controversial, old, or qa. Applied to the anonymous HTML request when metrics are enabled.

### `reddit_post`

- **HTTP:** `GET /reddit/post/{id}`
- **What:** Get Reddit post. Returns a normalized public Reddit post. The default 1-credit mode uses RSS. Set `include_metrics=true` to use the anonymous HTML post page as the sole content request and return public net score, upvote ratio, comment count, award count, and estimated upvote/downvote totals for 3 credits. Reddit fuzzes voting data, so estimates are approximate; share, repost/crosspost, and view counts are not exposed anonymously.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Reddit post id or t3_ id; `include_metrics` (boolean, optional) — Include public engagement metrics; costs 3 credits instead of 1

### `reddit_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /reddit/search`
- **What:** Search Reddit posts. Searches public Reddit content and returns normalized public post entries. A `503` with a `Retry-After` header means Reddit is temporarily throttling the request; wait that many seconds and retry.
- **Params:** `after` (string, optional) — Reddit pagination token; `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum posts, defaults to 25 and clamps to 100; `q` (string, **required**) — Search keywords; `sort` (string, optional) — Sort: relevance, hot, new, top, or comments; `subreddit` (string, optional) — Restrict search to a subreddit name, without r/; `time` (string, optional) — Time window for top/comments sorts: hour, day, week, month, year, or all
