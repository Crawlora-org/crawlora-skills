### `google_map_place`

- **HTTP:** `GET /google/map/place/{place_id}`
- **What:** Google Maps place details API. Returns detailed information for a specified place_id. Rate limit is enforced at 1 request per second.

### `google_map_place_photos`

- **HTTP:** `GET /google/map/place/{place_id}/photos`
- **What:** Google Maps place photos API. Returns the photos Google publishes for a specified place_id — the imagery shown on the place's Google Maps page, typically dozens of images for a well-covered business. Each entry carries the image URL as served plus its pixel dimensions when reported; swap the trailing size suffix on the URL (e.g. `=w203-h100-k-no`) to request other dimensions. Contributor avatars and review-attached photos are excluded. This is the place page's image set, not a paginated archive feed. Rate limit is enforced at 1 request per second.

Photo-only reviews return an empty `text`. This is the place page's first page of reviews, not the full review archive. Rate limit is enforced at 1 request per second.
- **Params:** `limit` (integer, optional) — Maximum number of reviews to return. Omit or 0 for all captured.; `place_id` (string, **required**) — Google Place ID
