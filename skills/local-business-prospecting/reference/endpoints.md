## Datasets (4)

### `datasets_google_map_facets`

- **HTTP:** `GET /datasets/google-map-businesses/facets`
- **What:** Facet stored Google Maps businesses. Returns terms aggregation counts for Google Maps businesses. Facet enum: `category`, `country`, `state`, `state_code`, `county`, `county_code`, `city`, `town`, `website_status`. Category facet values are exact locale-specific Google Maps labels and can be localized, non-ASCII, or contain punctuation; pass a returned value unchanged to the category filter. `state` and `county` keep each country's own administrative vocabulary (e.g. `Provincia de Madrid`, `Département du Nord`); `state_code` and `county_code` are the matching ISO 3166-2 codes (e.g. `ES-MD`, `FR-59`) and are the stable cross-country grouping key. Rows not yet resolved carry no code and are absent from the code facets.
- **Params:** `category` (string, optional) — Exact locale-specific Google Maps category label; use the category facet to discover values, max 128 characters; `city` (string, optional) — Exact city filter, max 128 characters; `country` (string, optional) — Country filter. Accepts the full English name (\; `county` (string, optional) — Exact county filter, max 128 characters; `county_code` (string, optional) — Exact ISO 3166-2 county/district code filter, e.g. FR-59 or IT-RM, max 128 characters; use facet=county_code to discover values; `facet` (string, **required**) — Facet enum: category, country, state, state_code, county, county_code, city, town, website_status; `has_geo` (boolean, optional) — Filter by location presence: true keeps only mappable businesses with coordinates; false isolates locationless service-area businesses that have no map location; `has_phone` (boolean, optional) — Filter by phone presence; `has_website` (boolean, optional) — Filter by website presence; `lat` (number, optional) — Latitude for radius filtering; `lon` (number, optional) — Longitude for radius filtering; `min_rating` (number, optional) — Minimum rating, 0 through 5.

- **HTTP:** `GET /apple-maps/place`
- **What:** Get one Apple Maps place's full detail. Returns one Apple Maps place by its place ID: name, type, category taxonomy, coordinates, formatted and structured address, phone numbers, website, rating and review count, price level, weekly opening hours, amenities (payment, accessibility, parking, and similar yes/no attributes), photos, review snippets (text, rating, time, and source link, without reviewer identity), the business-claim link, and the IDs of Apple Guides that include the place. Accepts either the external place ID (starts with I, the place-id= value in a maps.apple.com/place URL) or the numeric ID from a search result.
- **Params:** `country` (string, optional) — Two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code selecting Apple's regional catalog. Defaults to US.; `lang` (string, optional) — Display language as a BCP 47 tag, e.g. en-US, ja-JP, de-DE. Defaults to en-US.; `place_id` (string, **required**) — Apple place ID: external form (I594FECA0B369D14A) or numeric id from a search result

### `apple_maps_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /apple-maps/search`
- **What:** Search Apple Maps places near a coordinate. Returns Apple Maps places matching a keyword, business name, category, or street address near a coordinate. Each place carries its Apple place ID (the value the place endpoint takes), name, category, coordinates, formatted and structured address, phone, website, rating and review count, price level, weekly opening hours, and a hero photo. Apple returns a bounded set per viewport (around 25 places for the default span) with no pagination; widen the span or move the center to cover more area. When nothing matches near the center Apple may relocate the search to a default region, reported by relocated=true and the region bounds. The response's filters block lists the refinement chips Apple offers for this query and area (open now, top rated, in guides, cuisines, price bands, amenities, accolades, sort); pass their keys back as filters and sort to refine the same search.
- **Params:** `country` (string, optional) — Two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code selecting Apple's regional catalog. Defaults to US.; `filters` (string, optional) — Comma-separated filter keys from the filters block of an unfiltered search for the same query and area, e.g. OPEN_NOW, TOP_RATED, FEATURED_IN_GUIDES, PRICE_RANGE_MODERATE, modern_pizza_restaurant, ACCEPTS_CREDIT_CARDS. Unknown keys return 400 listing the available keys. Costs a second upstream search.; `lang` (string, optional) — Display language as a BCP 47 tag, e.g. en-US, ja-JP, de-DE. Defaults to en-US.; `latitude` (number, **required**) — Search center latitude; `limit` (integer, optional) — Max places returned. Defaults to 25, maximum 100.; `longitude` (number, **required**) — Search center longitude; `query` (string, **required**) — Keyword, business name, category, or street address to search for; `sort` (string, optional) — Result order. Costs a second upstream search.; `span` (number, optional) — Search viewport size in degrees of latitude/longitude around the center. Defaults to 0.05 (roughly a 5km box); minimum 0.001, maximum 5.

- **What:** Get Yelp business detail. Looks up a single Yelp business by alias or encoded id via Yelp's real Android app backend. Credential-free: no login, no API key, no cookie required from the caller.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Yelp business alias or encoded id

### `yelp_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /yelp/search`
- **What:** Search Yelp businesses. Searches Yelp's real Android app business-search backend for a term and location. Credential-free: no login, no API key, no cookie required from the caller.

## Web (2)

### `extract`

- **HTTP:** `POST /extract`
- **What:** Extract schema-conforming JSON from a URL. Scrapes a public URL into clean Markdown, then returns data that strictly conforms to the supplied bounded JSON Schema.
- **Params:** `extractOption` (object, **required**) — Extraction options
- **REST body:** Send the value of the MCP argument `extractOption` directly as the JSON body; do not wrap it in a `extractOption` property.

### `web_scrape`

- **HTTP:** `POST /web/scrape`
- **What:** Scrape a URL into markdown, HTML, links or metadata. Fetches a single public URL and returns clean content in the requested formats (markdown, html, raw_html, links, metadata). The request body IS the ScrapeOption object itself — e.g. {"url": "https://example.com"} — do not wrap it in an extra key. With render=auto the request starts as a fast HTTP fetch and escalates to a real browser when the page is blocked or rendered with JavaScript; backend only pins a specific headless-browser engine for the browser tier and is not a render mode. only_main_content (default true) strips navigation, headers, footers and other boilerplate before conversion. Only public pages are supported; respect each site's terms of use and robots directives. A handful of popular sites (Amazon, Reddit, Yelp, LinkedIn, and others) already have a dedicated, more reliable endpoint elsewhere in this API — a failed scrape against one of them names it.
- **Params:** `scrapeOption` (object, **required**) — Scrape options
- **REST body:** Send the value of the MCP argument `scrapeOption` directly as the JSON body; do not wrap it in a `scrapeOption` property.
