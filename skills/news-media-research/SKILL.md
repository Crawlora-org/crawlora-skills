# News media research

Search and read public publisher coverage as normalized JSON. This skill is
for outlet-native retrieval; use `news-briefing-research` when the task needs a
multi-source synthesis, coverage timeline, or GDELT context.

## When to use this skill

- Get the latest headlines for a section, topic, or publisher.
- Read a public article's body and metadata from its canonical URL.
- Search Financial Times or Google News, or browse a publisher's section/topic
  archive after discovering its current slugs.
- Inspect BBC/CNN live coverage or Foreign Policy project/live surfaces.

## Setup

- Get a Crawlora API key at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- Set `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` in the environment before running the helper.
- The helper reads `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` from the environment and sends requests
  to `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`.

## Research workflow

1. Start with the publisher's discovery surface when one exists: categories,
   sections, or topics return the current accepted slugs for the matching
   headline route. Do not invent section values.
2. Fetch a bounded headline/search page, preserve each result's canonical URL,
   publication/update time, author, and section, then pass that URL to the
   publisher's article endpoint when full text is needed.
3. Treat feeds as publisher-specific snapshots, not an exhaustive news corpus.
   For a comparison across outlets, keep each publisher's result set and
   timestamps separate before synthesizing.
4. Use live-story, project, or conversation routes only for the publisher
   surfaces that expose them; they are snapshots, not subscriptions.

Use [`reference/endpoints.md`](reference/endpoints.md) for exact parameters.

## Examples

```sh
scripts/crawlora.sh /nyt/sections | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /nyt/headlines section=world | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /nyt/article url="https://www.nytimes.com/example" | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /ft/search q="semiconductor exports" sort=date | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /reuters/news page=1 | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /foreignpolicy/live | jq '.'
```

## Limits

- Public publisher content only; subscriber-only, metered, challenged, video,
  podcast, and live-blog surfaces may be unavailable or partial.
- Preserve the source URL and the publisher's timestamps. Do not present a
  bounded feed as complete coverage or infer truth from headline agreement.
- Quote sparingly and link the original article. Use `news-briefing-research`
  for cross-source comparison and uncertainty-aware synthesis.
