Keyword search is Algolia's own typo-tolerant relevance ranking, not a guaranteed exact match. A query with genuinely zero matches returns a well-formed empty result rather than an error.

Listings only ever contains that seller's ACTIVE listings; use grailed-sold-listings with a designer/query filter for a broader sales-history lookup, since sold listings are not filterable by seller through this endpoint.

- **What:** List Hermès category codes. Returns every browsable Hermès category for a market: the category code hermes-category accepts, its display name, its page path and absolute URL, its parent code and its depth in the tree. This is the discovery endpoint for hermes-category's category parameter, so every accepted value is obtainable from this API rather than by reading the website. Editorial and story tiles that carry no browsable category page are excluded, so every code returned is one hermes-category will accept.
- **Params:** `locale` (string, optional) — Market and language. One of: at_de, au_en, be_en, be_fr, br_pt, ca_en, ca_fr, ch_de, ch_fr, cz_en, de_de, dh_en, dk_en, es_es, fi_en, fr_fr, gr_en, hk_en, ie_en, it_it, jp_ja, kr_ko, lu_fr, mo_en, mx_es, my_en, nl_en, no_en, pl_en, pt_en, ri_en, se_en, sg_en, th_en, tw_zh, uk_en, us_en

The category parameter takes a category code from hermes-categories, which is the discovery endpoint for every accepted value. Page size is fixed at 48 by Hermès and cannot be changed. Prices are returned with the ISO-4217 currency for the selected market, since Hermès itself publishes bare numbers.
- **Params:** `category` (string, **required**) — Hermès category code, from hermes-categories; `locale` (string, optional) — Market and language.

Built from Hermès' own product sitemap, so it enumerates the entire catalogue for that market including items no category listing surfaces. Use changed_since to return only products added or updated on or after a date, which makes this a new-arrivals feed. The product_id is the identifier used in the product URL and is NOT the same string as the sku returned by hermes-category and hermes-search, which also encodes size.

- **Params:** `locale` (string, optional) — Market and language.

### `goat_suggest`
