## Datasets (7)

### `datasets_sec_companies_facets`

Facet enum: `sic`, `sic_description`, `exchange`, `state_of_incorporation`, `entity_type`, `reporting_currency`, `revenue_band`, `forms_filed`. `revenue_band` buckets latest-annual revenue into: `unknown`, `under_1m`, `1m_10m`, `10m_100m`, `100m_1b`, `1b_10b`, `over_10b`.
- **Params:** `entity_type` (string, optional) — Exact entity-type filter, max 64 characters; `exchange` (string, optional) — Exact exchange filter as reported by EDGAR, max 64 characters; `facet` (string, **required**) — Facet enum: sic, sic_description, exchange, state_of_incorporation, entity_type, reporting_currency, revenue_band, forms_filed; `form_filed` (string, optional) — Exact form-type filter, e.g. 10-K, 8-K; `has_financials` (boolean, optional) — When true, keep only companies that have XBRL financial statements; `min_revenue` (number, optional) — Minimum latest-annual revenue in USD (normalized at reference rates), 0 or greater; `q` (string, optional) — Full-text query over the company name, or an exact ticker match, max 256 characters; `reporting_currency` (string, optional) — Exact reporting-currency filter, ISO-4217 code, e.g. USD, JPY, EUR; `sic` (string, optional) — Exact SIC industry-code filter, max 32 characters; `state_of_incorporation` (string, optional) — Exact state/country-of-incorporation filter, max 32 characters; `ticker` (string, optional) — Exact ticker filter (case-insensitive), max 32 characters

- **What:** Get a SEC company's financial-statement history. Returns a company's normalized financial-statement history (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) from the SEC companies dataset, newest fiscal year first. An unknown CIK or a company with no XBRL data returns an empty series rather than a 404 — most filers without a current ticker have no financial-statement history at all. `lines` keys are the same normalized concept names the live `/sec/financials` endpoint uses (e.g. `revenue`, `net_income`, `total_assets`); `ratios` keys include `gross_margin`, `operating_margin`, `net_margin`, `revenue_growth_yoy`, `current_ratio`, `debt_to_equity`, `free_cash_flow` where derivable. statement enum: `income`, `balance`, `cash_flow`. period enum: `annual`, `quarterly`.

## Web (1)

### `web_scrape`

- **HTTP:** `POST /web/scrape`
- **What:** Scrape a URL into markdown, HTML, links or metadata. Fetches a single public URL and returns clean content in the requested formats (markdown, html, raw_html, links, metadata). The request body IS the ScrapeOption object itself — e.g. {"url": "https://example.com"} — do not wrap it in an extra key. With render=auto the request starts as a fast HTTP fetch and escalates to a real browser when the page is blocked or rendered with JavaScript; backend only pins a specific headless-browser engine for the browser tier and is not a render mode. only_main_content (default true) strips navigation, headers, footers and other boilerplate before conversion. Only public pages are supported; respect each site's terms of use and robots directives. A handful of popular sites (Amazon, Reddit, Yelp, LinkedIn, and others) already have a dedicated, more reliable endpoint elsewhere in this API — a failed scrape against one of them names it.
- **Params:** `scrapeOption` (object, **required**) — Scrape options
- **REST body:** Send the value of the MCP argument `scrapeOption` directly as the JSON body; do not wrap it in a `scrapeOption` property.
